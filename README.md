# Web-Crowler
We're going to write a Golang CLI application that generates an "internal links" report for any website on the internet by crawling each page of the site.

In this project, we'll build a Web Crawler in Golang! To rank well in Google Search, websites need to internally link pages one to another. For example, a blog post about the benefits of haircuts should probably link to my post about the best places to get haircuts.

# Setup
Before we dive into the project, let's make sure you are all set up properly. You will need:

All instructions will assume a bash-like/unix-like environment. I recommend WSL 2 if you're on Windows so that you can... not be.
The latest Go toolchain installed.
If you're in VS Code, I recommend installing the Go extension. It's not required, but it makes working with Go a lot easier.
You will need the Boot.dev CLI installed, and you'll need to be logged in.
